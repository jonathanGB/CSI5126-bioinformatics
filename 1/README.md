This project has been written using **Go**. The only requirement is to have **Go** installed (currently running `go1.9`, but it should work with `go1.5+`).

Every problem is separated in its own directory. To run the program, move to the problem directory and run the program:

``` bash
cd q1
go run solution.go
```

There is also a special directory `utils`, which defines helpers and *structs* around *FASTA* reading that are then used by the solutions.

NB: **q4** doesn't have a *go* program; rather, the solution is discussed inside `solution.txt`
