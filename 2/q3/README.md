To run this program, you need to install external dependencies (as plotting is not part of the core language).

If that's the case, simply run `python3 solution.py --plot` â€” the program runs in around ~1min.

I've provided in this current folder 4 images of successive runs of the algorithm; the distribution is pretty stable around 8, with some variations (sometimes 13 is the maximum and sometimes not, for example).

To answer question 3, which asked:
> Does it look like any distribution that you know of?

I would say that it looks pretty much like a normal distribution, but it doesn't quite have the symetry we would expect from a "bell curve".
